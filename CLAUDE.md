# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an educational documentation repository designed to help growing developers learn how to use VS Code and GitHub for creating comprehensive project documentation. The goal is to demonstrate best practices for creating README files, whitepapers, roadmaps, and technical documentation that can be shared publicly or kept private.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource and template for developers to:

- Learn documentation best practices using VS Code and GitHub
- Understand how to structure project documentation
- Create clear, informative content for both public and private audiences
- Provide rapid, accessible insights to developers and their communities
- Build professional documentation including: README.md, whitepapers, roadmaps, technical docs, and code documentation

## Repository Structure

Documentation should be organized to support both learning and reference:
- **README.md**: Entry point explaining the project and how to use the documentation
- **Whitepapers**: In-depth technical explanations and project vision
- **Roadmaps**: Project timelines, milestones, and future plans
- **Documentation**: Technical guides, API docs, and user manuals
- **Code Documentation**: Inline comments, code examples, and architectural notes

## Documentation Philosophy

When creating or updating documentation in this repository:
- **Clarity First**: Write for developers at various skill levels
- **Practical Examples**: Include real-world code examples and use cases
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, link to detailed information
- **Accessibility**: Ensure documentation is discoverable and well-organized
- **Public vs Private**: Consider what information is appropriate for public vs private repositories

## Development Workflow

This is primarily a documentation repository using Markdown files. Development workflow:
- Edit `.md` files in VS Code
- Use Git for version control
- Leverage GitHub for collaboration and sharing
- Preview Markdown rendering before committing
