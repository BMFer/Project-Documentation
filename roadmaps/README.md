## Roadmap Best Practices

### Structure

A good roadmap includes:

1. **Vision**: Where you're headed long-term
2. **Themes**: High-level focus areas
3. **Timeframes**: Quarters or release cycles
4. **Features/Goals**: Specific items with status
5. **Dependencies**: What must happen first
6. **Risks**: Potential blockers or challenges

### Keeping Roadmaps Current

- **Review regularly**: Update monthly or quarterly
- **Mark completed items**: Show progress visually
- **Adjust timelines**: Be realistic about delays
- **Communicate changes**: Keep stakeholders informed
- **Version control**: Track how plans evolve

### Public vs Private Roadmaps

- Competitive information
- Unannounced features

### Visual Formats

Consider using:
- **Gantt charts**: For timeline visualization

- **Tables**: For structured information
- **Diagrams**: For dependencies
