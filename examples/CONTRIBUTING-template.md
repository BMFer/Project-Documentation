## Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-user-authentication`
- `fix/navbar-alignment-issue`
- `docs/update-api-reference`
- `refactor/simplify-data-processing`

### Making Changes

1. **Keep changes focused** - One feature/fix per PR
2. **Write tests** - Aim for 80%+ code coverage
3. **Document your code** - Clear comments and documentation
4. **Follow existing patterns** - Be consistent with the codebase

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.spec.js
```

### Building

```bash
# Development build
npm run build:dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Build and watch for changes
npm run build:watch
```

## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

This project uses:

- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Style Guide**: [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) (or your preferred guide)

```bash
# Check code style
npm run lint

# Auto-fix style issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Guidelines

- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Prefer arrow functions for anonymous functions
- Use template literals for string concatenation
- Use destructuring when appropriate
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

**Example:**

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the sum of two numbers
 * @param {number} a - First number
 * @param {number} b - Second number
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b
 */
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/      # Reusable components
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ services/       # API services
â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # Type definitions
â””â”€â”€ index.js        # Entry point
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Keep formatting consistent
- Update table of contents when adding sections

## Commit Messages

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```

Implement JWT-based authentication with login and signup endpoints.

Closes #123
```

```

```

### Best Practices

- Use the imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Don't end the subject line with a period
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests
