## Documentation Best Practices

When creating technical documentation:

1. **Start with the user's perspective** - What problem are they trying to solve?
2. **Use clear, concise language** - Avoid jargon when possible
3. **Include code examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Keep it updated** - Documentation should evolve with the code
5. **Link between related docs** - Help users navigate complex topics

## Structure

Organize documentation by audience and purpose:
- **Getting Started**: For new users
- **Guides**: Task-oriented instructions
- **Reference**: Detailed technical specifications
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step learning paths
