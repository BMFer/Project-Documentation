## Security Considerations

### .gitignore Best Practices

Create comprehensive `.gitignore`:

```bash
# Secrets and credentials
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
*.pem
*.key
*.p12
*.pfx
config/secrets.yml
credentials.json

# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*.log

# Database files
*.db
*.sqlite
*.sql

# Backup files
*.bak
*.tmp
~$*

# Environment specific
config/production.yml
config/local.yml
```

### Scanning for Secrets

**Pre-commit Hooks**:

Install `git-secrets`:
```bash
# Install
brew install git-secrets  # macOS
apt-get install git-secrets  # Linux

# Setup
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
```

**GitHub Secret Scanning**:
- Automatically enabled for public repositories
- Available for private repos with GitHub Advanced Security
- Detects common secret patterns
- Notifies on detection

**Third-party Tools**:
- **TruffleHog**: Find secrets in Git history
- **GitGuardian**: Real-time secret detection
- **detect-secrets**: Yelp's secret scanner
- **gitleaks**: Fast secret scanner

**Example: Using TruffleHog**:
```bash
# Install
pip install truffleHog

# Scan repository
truffleHog --regex --entropy=False https://github.com/user/repo
```

### Secret Rotation

**If Secret is Exposed**:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke the compromised credential immediately
   - Generate new credential
   - Update all systems using it
   - Monitor for unauthorized access

2. **Remove from Git History**:
   ```bash
   # Using BFG Repo-Cleaner (recommended)
   bfg --replace-text passwords.txt repo.git
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive

   # Push changes
   git push --force
   ```

3. **Notification**:
   - Notify security team
   - Document incident
   - Review access logs
   - Consider notifying affected users (if applicable)

### Environment Variables

**Instead of hardcoding**:
```javascript
// ‚ùå BAD
const apiKey = 'sk_live_51HqE2KLOp5...';

// ‚úÖ GOOD
const apiKey = process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY;
```

**Document in README** (without actual values):
```markdown
## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

\`\`\`bash
# API Keys
STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_key_here
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key_here

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname

# Application
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
\`\`\`

See `.env.example` for template.
```

**Provide .env.example**:
```bash
# .env.example - Safe to commit
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/myapp_dev
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

## Business Considerations

### Competitive Intelligence

**What Competitors Can Learn from Public Docs**:
- Your technology stack
- Feature roadmap
- Customer base size
- Integration partners
- Pricing structure (if documented)
- Development velocity
- Team size (from commits)

**Protecting Competitive Advantage**:

**Public** (general):
```markdown
## Technology Stack
- Modern web technologies
- Cloud-based infrastructure
- Scalable architecture
```

**Private** (specific):
```markdown
## Technology Stack
- React 18.2 with Next.js 14
- Node.js 20 with Express
- PostgreSQL 15 with TimescaleDB
- Redis 7 for caching
- Deployed on AWS EKS with Fargate
- Using DataDog for monitoring
```

### Intellectual Property

**Patent-Pending Features**:
```markdown
# ‚ùå Don't document publicly before patent filing:
"We use a novel algorithm that combines X, Y, and Z
to achieve 10x performance improvement..."

# ‚úÖ After patent filing or if not patenting:
"Advanced optimization techniques provide
significant performance improvements."
```

**Proprietary Algorithms**:
- Don't publish detailed implementations
- Provide high-level descriptions
- Document public APIs, not internal logic

### Partnership Considerations

**Before Public Announcement**:
```markdown
‚ùå "Upcoming integration with Microsoft Teams"
‚ùå "Partnership with Salesforce coming Q2"
```

**After Public Announcement**:
```markdown
‚úÖ "Now integrates with Microsoft Teams"
‚úÖ "Salesforce integration available"
```

**In Private Docs**:
```markdown
## Partner Integration Roadmap (CONFIDENTIAL)

Q1 2025:
- Finalize Microsoft Teams integration (under NDA)
- Begin Salesforce discussions

Q2 2025:
- Public launch of Teams integration
- Announce Salesforce partnership
```

### Customer Confidentiality

**Case Studies** - Get permission:
```markdown
# ‚ùå Without permission
"Acme Corp uses our platform to manage 10,000 projects
and has reduced costs by 30%."

# ‚úÖ With permission (or anonymized)
"A Fortune 500 manufacturing company uses our platform
to manage thousands of projects, reducing costs by 30%."
```

**Customer Lists**:
- ‚ùå Never publish full customer lists without consent
- ‚úÖ "Trusted by over 500 companies"
- ‚úÖ Logo wall with permission
- ‚úÖ Anonymous usage statistics

- ‚ùå Mix public and private content in same repo

### Dual Documentation Strategy

**Maintain Both**:

```
company-docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public-docs/          # Public repository
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/

        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security-review.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release-checklist.md
```

**Cross-linking**:

In public docs:
```markdown
## Architecture

For a high-level overview, see our architecture decisions.

For detailed infrastructure documentation, see internal wiki.
(Internal team members: link to private docs)
```

### Documentation Reviews

**Before Publishing**:

1. **Automated Scanning**:
   ```bash
   # Scan for secrets
   truffleHog --regex --entropy=False .

   # Scan for email addresses
   grep -r '@company.com' .

   # Scan for IP addresses
   grep -rE '\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b' .
   ```

2. **Manual Review Checklist**:
   - [ ] No credentials or secrets
   - [ ] No internal URLs or IPs
   - [ ] No personal information
   - [ ] No unpublished features
   - [ ] No proprietary algorithms
   - [ ] No customer-specific information
   - [ ] Links work
   - [ ] Code examples tested
   - [ ] Screenshots don't reveal sensitive data

3. **Peer Review**:
   - Have another team member review
   - Security team review for sensitive topics
   - Legal review if needed

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Committing Secrets

**Problem**:
```bash
git commit -m "Add API integration"
# Accidentally committed .env file with real credentials
```

**Prevention**:
- Proper `.gitignore`
- Pre-commit hooks
- Secret scanning
- Code review

**Fix** (if caught immediately):
```bash
# Remove from last commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset HEAD .env
git commit -m "Add API integration"
```

**Fix** (if already pushed):
```bash
# Remove from history
bfg --delete-files .env
git push --force
# THEN: Rotate all exposed credentials immediately
```

### Mistake #2: Screenshots with Sensitive Data

**Problem**:
```markdown
## Dashboard Overview
![Dashboard](screenshot.png)
```

Screenshot shows:
- Real customer names
- Email addresses
- Internal URLs
- API keys in browser dev tools

**Prevention**:
- Use dummy/test data
- Blur sensitive information
- Use separate demo environment
- Review screenshots before committing

### Mistake #3: Detailed Error Messages

**Public Docs** (‚ùå Bad):
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

If you see error "Database connection failed":
- Check that PostgreSQL is running on db.internal.company.com:5432
- Verify username 'app_user' has correct permissions
- Ensure password matches value in Vault path 'prod/db/password'
```

**Public Docs** (‚úÖ Good):
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

If you see "Database connection failed":
- Check database server is running
- Verify connection credentials
- Ensure user has correct permissions
- See configuration guide for setup details
```

### Mistake #4: Oversharing in Git History

**Problem**:
```bash
git log
# commit abc123
# "Update config with production database credentials"
```

Even if file is removed, commit message reveals sensitive info.

**Prevention**:
- Review commit messages
- Avoid mentioning sensitive details
- Use generic descriptions for security changes

### Mistake #5: Public Issue Tracker for Security

**Problem**:
```markdown
GitHub Issue #123
Title: "SQL Injection vulnerability in login endpoint"
Description: "The login endpoint doesn't sanitize input..."
```

**Prevention**:
- Use private security reporting
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Dedicated security email
- Bug bounty platform (if applicable)

**Proper Approach**:
```markdown
SECURITY.md:

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities as GitHub issues.

Instead, email: security@company.com

Include:
- Description of vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
```

## Transitioning Between Public and Private

### Making a Private Repo Public

**Before Making Public**:

1. **Audit Git History**:
   ```bash
   # Search for common secret patterns
   git log -p | grep -i "password"
   git log -p | grep -i "api.key"
   git log -p | grep -i "secret"

   # Use automated tools
   truffleHog --regex --entropy=True .
   ```

2. **Review All Files**:
   ```bash
   # Check for sensitive files
   find . -name "*.env*"
   find . -name "*secret*"
   find . -name "*credential*"
   find . -name "config/*.yml"
   ```

3. **Clean Sensitive Data**:
   ```bash
   # Remove sensitive files from history
   bfg --delete-files sensitive-file.txt
   bfg --replace-text passwords.txt

   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Remove internal URLs
   - Remove employee names (if sensitive)
   - Remove customer references
   - Genericize examples

5. **Final Checklist**:
   - [ ] All secrets removed from history
   - [ ] .gitignore is comprehensive
   - [ ] README is public-friendly
   - [ ] No internal URLs or IPs
   - [ ] License added
   - [ ] Contributing guide added
   - [ ] Code of conduct added
   - [ ] Security policy added

6. **Make Public**:
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Danger Zone
   ‚Üí Change repository visibility ‚Üí Make public
   ```

### Making a Public Repo Private

**Reasons**:
- Security concerns discovered
- Business strategy change
- Proprietary development
- Privacy requirements

**Process**:

1. **Communicate Change**:
   ```markdown

   ```bash
   # Use GitHub CLI
   gh issue list --state all --limit 1000 > issues.csv
   gh pr list --state all --limit 1000 > prs.csv
   ```

3. **Make Private**:
